# Quizzit
Quizzit aims to reinvent the approach to creating and taking quizzes.

## What we aim to achieve
- Flexibility: We intend to make the system 99.9% configurable to the users. Users can own it and tweak it to their needs
- Openness: We believe great products thrive on community, therefore, we are making it 100% open. You can fork or clone for personal learning and if you have some spare time on your hands, you can submit a PR ðŸ˜‰.
- Success: The most important value of this project is to help people engage more effectively with quizzes without getting bored. With diverse learning content that will be curated by people all over the world, we believe that learners will leverage the platform to be more successful in their learning.
