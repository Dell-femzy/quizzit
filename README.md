## Quizzit
Quizzit aims to reinvent the approach to building quiz applications.

### What's we aim to achieve
- Flexibility: We intend to make the system 99.9% configurable to the users. Users can totally own it and tweak it to their needs
- Openness: We believe great products thrive on community, therefore, we are making it 100% open. You could fork or clone for personal learning and you could be kind enough to submit a PR ðŸ˜‰.
- Educentric: The most important value of this project is to help people become successful in their learning. With diverse learning content that will be curated by people all over the world, we believe that learners will take advantage of it to increase their knowledge.

### Architecture
!Monolith.

### Technologies
- Backend: Node, Express, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React/Redux

### Contributing
Currently, it's just [Femi]('https://github.com/andela-fabolaji') and [Abbey]('https//github.com/BalogunDell'). A few things are still in the works but we intend to let more people join the party as soon as we are stable.
